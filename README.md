# Pokémon React App #

Using React, please build a Single Page Application according to the wireframes using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#creating-an-app) as a boilerplate. The wireframes are a guideline for main components and layout.

## Includes ##
* React via create-react-app (ejected)
* node-sass already installed (this is a recommended tool that enables scss, but use whatever css stack you'd like)
* Redux already installed

## Requirements ##
* Single page app -- no react-router required
* Proxy the API provided in the Resources section of this ReadMe
* Use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html) at your discretion (not a requirement, but a plus if used appropriately)
* Import libraries (functionality is outlined in the Features section of this ReadMe):
    * [Moment](momentjs.com/docs/)
    * [Recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/examples/SimpleBarChart) or [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/simple-column-chart/)
    * [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (Our preferred HTTP client, fetch is fine too or any other you are more familiar with for this demo)
    * [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/auto-complete)

# Please give the API a second to spin up when you first visit the page!

## Components & Features (User Stories) ##

* As a User, I want to be able to type a Pokémon's name in a search box and have the component show me suggestions of Pokémon in a dropdown selectable list.
* As a User, when I select a Pokémon from the auto-suggest list I want to see that Pokémon's image, attack, defense, and type(s) in an InfoBox Component.
    * I want to see a unique color indication (text color, background color, etc) for a specific type of Pokémon.
* As a User, when I select a Pokémon from the auto-suggest list I want to see that Pokémon's basic statistics (attack, defense, stamina) in a BarChart Component.
    * X-axis: statistic name
    * Y-axis: value
    * If a value is >= 50, change the color of the bar to red.
    * If a value is <50 & >=20, change the color of the bar to yellow.
    * If a value is <20, change the color of the bar to grey.
* As a User, when I click on the Pokéball near the graph the data will toggle between basic statistics & moves

## Show Off ##

These are not required functionalities, but a few examples to show off some advanced skills.

* Responsiveness -- mobile and/or tablet
* Make the Pokéball using ONLY SCSS
* Make the Pokéball animate (rotate, bounce, grow/shrink, dealer's choice)
* Create a Middleware that triggers an easter egg
    * Intercept the Pokémon type and show an easter egg!
    * Ex: If a fire Pokémon is selected, make the screen flash red. If an ice Pokémon is selected, overlay the page with snowflakes.
* Game-ify this App!
    * Add a Screen for a game & link to it from the original app.
    * Give the User 2 random Pokémon by name.
    * Let the User select a sequence of 3 moves out of the total available moves for each Pokémon.
    * Battle the Pokémon... because that's what they do.
    * Show the victorious and defeated based on the sum of the move power values and the defense of the opposing Pokémon; whoever hits defense = 0 first loses.
